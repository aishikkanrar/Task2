Mentor: Neela Santhosh Kumar Overview of the Project The Weather Forecast App is a web-based application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for any city. By fetching data from a weather API, the app displays essential details such as the city name, country, temperature, and local time in a user-friendly interface. To enhance the user experience, the app also includes an image that represents the current weather condition.

Key Features Real-Time Weather Data: The app retrieves up-to-date weather information, including temperature, city, and country details, from a weather API.

Dynamic UI Updates: The interface updates dynamically based on user input, displaying relevant weather information for the specified city.

Weather Icons: The app shows an icon representing the current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy), making the information more visually appealing.

Responsive Design: Styled using CSS, the app is visually appealing and responsive across different devices, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.

Gradual Transitions and Visibility Effects: The output card with the weather data becomes visible with smooth transitions, adding a layer of sophistication to the user interface.

Project Structure HTML (index.html): Defines the structure of the app, containing input fields for the city, a search button, and an output section for displaying weather information.

CSS (styles.css): Styles the app with a modern, clean look, using gradients and subtle shadows. It also provides responsive design rules to ensure compatibility with various screen sizes.

JavaScript (app.js): Contains the logic to handle user input and fetch weather data from the API. It updates the DOM elements dynamically based on the fetched data and manages the visibility and styling of elements based on user interactions.
